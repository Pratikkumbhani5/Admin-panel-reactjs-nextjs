      "I currently taking 1:1 sessions. She is knowledgeable, calm and always encourages me to push my boundaries. I have issues with my back, shoulder and hips. I've had only 15 sessions, my hips are more aligned because my muscles are nicely stretching. My back is feeling stronger, my sitting posture is beautifully tall and straight. To top it off, I have not had a session where I'm too sore to move the next day.",
