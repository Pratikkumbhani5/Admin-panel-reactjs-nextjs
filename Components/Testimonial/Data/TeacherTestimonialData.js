      "I'm learning Pilates course from Dr.Deepali and I swear I haven't met a coach like her. She's the best. She will push you to your limits and help you heal inside out. She's a beautiful soul and want to be around to get guidance. Super patient yet a powerhouse of knowledge. She will make you do things effortlessly. She indeed makes difficult things look very simple and would guide you to do the same. And the best part is these difficult exercises that the course had plus that one entire book she made us do like a cakewalk. I haven't met a superwoman like her and I don't have exact words but then she's truly the best. The studio, equipment, training, everything is worth every penny!",

      "I just finished my Balanced Body based Virtual Mat series with Dr Deepali. I had the most wonderful transformational time during this series. I am really glad that I made this decision, as I feel extremely blessed and fortunate to be trained under Dr Deepali. She is an excellent mentor as she is very approachable and remarkably knowledgeable too. She guides and encourages you to push your limits as she is a good role model for us to realize how much more we need to challenge ourselves. What is most impressive is that the quality of teaching and workouts are exceptional and the virtual classes were fabulous. I came out of the course with a strong base and understood Pilates is more than just an exercise method as it changed my relationship with exercise. I feel highly accomplished in my journey of the teacher training course in Mat series. I highly recommend Pilates training (for a teacher training course or daily workouts) from iKore Pilates under Deepali Ma'am. Thanks, Ma'am, for all the support and encouragement",

      "I have known Dr. Deepali Gupta since 2017 and recently, I undertook the Mat 3 Teacher Training Course under the able guidance of Dr. Deepali. Firstly, I would like to mention that iKore Pilates studio is just the right choice for an intensive Pilates session. The perfect ambience and vast array of equipment in the studio would make anyone feel the need to try out the different types of exercises on the various equipment available. Secondly, Dr. Deepali is technically proficient and excellent in her teaching, especially her crisp and clear cueing ensures the exercise is done properly. I would like to conclude that this is the best place to be in if one is looking for a full-body workout and an in-depth understanding of the science behind each exercise. Would highly recommend iKore Pilates Studio and Dr. Deepali Gupta!",
